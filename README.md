##Project Summary: AI Notes Summarizer

This project is a web-based application that helps users transform their notes into concise summaries and flashcards. The application allows users to input text (notes) and processes the text to generate a summary, key points, and flashcards. The main features include:

Note Input: Users can input their notes, and the app generates a summarized version based on the input.
Summary Generation: The app creates a summary that condenses the notes into a few key sentences, making it easier for the user to review.
Key Points Extraction: The app extracts important points from the notes and lists them for easy reference.
Flashcard Generation: Based on the notes, the app generates flashcards that contain questions and answers to help users study and retain key information.
History Tracking: The app saves previously processed notes, summaries, key points, and flashcards in local storage. Users can view, delete, or load past entries from their history.
User Interface: The app has an intuitive and interactive UI with features like flashing cards that can be flipped to reveal answers, a summary section, and a clean layout that helps users easily navigate through the content.
The project uses React for the frontend and localStorage to persist the user data. It's designed to be a useful tool for students and professionals who want to summarize and create study material quickly and efficiently.
